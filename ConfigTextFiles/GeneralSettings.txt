# Guild General Settings Configuration Menu
# This menu contains all the values that are too 'generic' for their own menus.
# What would you like to do?

1.) Set Server Prefix (Currently Set To: '%prefix%')
2.) Enable/Disable Autoblocking Discord Invites* (Currently '%invite%')

* This means Discord invites within the server will be automatically deleted unless the user has the ManageServer Permission.
